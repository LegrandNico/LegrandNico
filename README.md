# About me

I am a researcher in artificial intelligence with a strong interest in probabilistic modelling, causal inference and innovative neural network frameworks, such as predictive coding or self-organizing structures. My main passion is to create algorithms and agents that can perceive, learn, decide and act under environmental uncertainty, with a strong focus on computational efficiency. I am a proficient Python and Rust programmer, and the creator of several open-source packages for physiological signal analysis, psychophysiology experiments, neural networks and computational models of learning and metacognition. I am an experienced data scientist with more than 10 years of practice and have completed several research projects, all involving advanced use of machine learning, cognitive modelling, signal processing, inferential statistics, experimental design or (neuro)physiological recording.

I am the creator and maintainer of the following Python libraries:

* [pyhgf](https://github.com/ilabcode/pyhgf) - A JAX implementation of the generalized and nodalized Hierarchical Gaussian filter.
* [Systole](https://LegrandNico.github.io/systole/index.html) - a package centred on processing and visualization of ECG, PPG and respiratory signals.
* [The Cardioception Toolbox](https://github.com/LegrandNico/cardioception-toolbox) - a psychophysics experiment to measure and analyze cardiac interoceptive beliefs (see also [the method paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301051121002325))
* [metadPy](https://LegrandNico.github.io/metadPy/) - a package to compute a variety of metacognitive efficiency parameters from trial-level confidence ratings (SDT, meta-*d* using MLE and Bayesian methods).

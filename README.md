# About me

I am a postdoctoral fellow in the [Embodied Computation Group](https://www.the-ecg.org/) at [Aarhus University](https://international.au.dk/) where I study cardiac interoception using computational modelling, brain imaging and physiological signal analysis.

I am the creator and maintainer of the following Python libraries:

* [Systole](https://embodied-computation-group.github.io/systole/index.html) - a package centred on processing and visualization of ECG, PPG and respiratory signals.
* [Cardioception](https://embodied-computation-group.github.io/Cardioception/) - a task using PsychoPy to measure and analyze cardiac interoceptive beliefs (see also [the method paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301051121002325))
* metadPy - a package to compute a variety of metacognitive efficiency parameters from trial-level confidence ratings (SDT, meta-*d* using MLE and Bayesian methods).

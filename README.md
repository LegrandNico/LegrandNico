# About me

I am currently working as a postdoctoral researcher in computational psychiatry at the [Ilab](https://github.com/ilabcode) where I develop nonparametric Bayesian models to approach the formation of delusionary beliefs.

Previously, I was working as postdoctoral fellow in the [Embodied Computation Group](https://www.the-ecg.org/) at [Aarhus University](https://international.au.dk/) where I studied cardiac interoception using computational modelling, brain imaging and physiological signal analysis.

I am the creator and maintainer of the following Python libraries:

* [Systole](https://embodied-computation-group.github.io/systole/index.html) - a package centred on processing and visualization of ECG, PPG and respiratory signals.
* [Cardioception](https://embodied-computation-group.github.io/Cardioception/) - a psychophysics experiment to measure and analyze cardiac interoceptive beliefs (see also [the method paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301051121002325))
* [metadPy](https://embodied-computation-group.github.io/metadPy/) - a package to compute a variety of metacognitive efficiency parameters from trial-level confidence ratings (SDT, meta-*d* using MLE and Bayesian methods).
* [pyhgf](https://github.com/ilabcode/pyhgf) - A JAX implementation of the generalized and nodalized Hierarchical Gaussian fliter.
